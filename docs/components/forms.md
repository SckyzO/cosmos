# Forms

Storybook group: Forms. The text fields, selects and pickers are documented in Storybook; this page holds the ones that need more than their props. The rich text editor is in [Optional entries](../guides/optional-entries.md#editor).

## Slider

Storybook: [Slider](https://sckyzo.github.io/cosmos/?path=/docs/forms-slider--docs).

`Slider` is a position on a scale, or a range of it. One `value` (with `defaultValue` and
`onChange(value)`): a number draws one handle, a pair `[minimum, maximum]` draws two, which can meet
but never cross. `min`, `max` and `step` default to 0, 100 and 1. `label` sits on the left of the
header, the current value on the right, and `min` and `max` under the track; `formatValue(n)` writes
all of them and the value a screen reader announces. `label` also names the handles ("Price minimum"
and "Price maximum" for a range): without a visible label, give `aria-label`. `marks` draws a tick at
every `step`, `intent` colors the fill (`brand`, `success`, `warning` or `danger`).

```tsx
<Slider
  label="Price"
  defaultValue={[200, 800]}
  max={1000}
  step={10}
  formatValue={(n) => `$${n}`}
  onChange={(range) => setPrice(range)}
/>
```

## Colour and phone fields

Storybook: [Color Input](https://sckyzo.github.io/cosmos/?path=/docs/forms-color-input--docs), [Phone Input](https://sckyzo.github.io/cosmos/?path=/docs/forms-phone-input--docs).

`ColorInput` picks a colour from named swatches (a radio group, arrows move between them) or a hex
field with a preview square. The value is the lowercase `#rrggbb`: the field accepts `#abc`, `abc`
and `#aabbcc`, and only a valid hex reaches `onChange(hex)`. Leaving the field with an invalid draft
shows an error and keeps the value. `presets` replaces the eight default swatches (`[]` for the hex
field alone); each is a `{ value, label }`, and the label is what a screen reader announces.

`PhoneInput` joins a country list and the number field in one border. The value is the E.164 number
(`+33612345678`) or `''`: `onChange(value)` gets `''` until the number is valid, which the light
check decides (digits only, 4 or more, 15 at most with the country code). The list searches by
name, ISO code or calling code; names come from `Intl.DisplayNames` in the page language.
`defaultCountry` (an ISO 3166-1 code, `US` by default) sets the country until a number says
otherwise, and `countries` limits the list. Typing `+` and a known calling code switches the
country, picking a country keeps the digits. A calling code shared by several countries keeps the
current one if it has it, else takes the code's main country. The package carries no phone metadata:
`format(country, national)` shapes the digits as they are typed and `validate(value)` returns the
message for a number it rejects, so a host can plug `libphonenumber-js` in.

```tsx
<ColorInput label="Event colour" value={colour} onChange={setColour} />

<PhoneInput
  label="Phone number"
  defaultCountry="FR"
  value={phone}
  onChange={setPhone}
  validate={(v) => (isValidPhoneNumber(v) ? undefined : 'Enter a valid phone number.')}
/>
```
